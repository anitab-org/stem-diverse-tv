STEM Diverse TV is an app that provides inspiring, motivating, supportive, educational and informative video content to promote and increase diversity in STEM. We chose video content first because this is a growing trend in younger generations and this specific generation can make a real impact on the future rate of diversity in STEM.

We are trying to focus on all areas of diversity and we are here to hear from every underrepresented group in STEM.

For now, the backend goal is to serve data, however, in future, we would like to include machine learning and big data analysis to provide more content.

We are looking forward to supporting in providing videos from organizations, institutions, schools, universities, companies as well as independent video publishers like Youtubers.

It's all about a diverse future. Let's start it now!
